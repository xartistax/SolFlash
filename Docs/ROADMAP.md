## 📝 Next Task: Implement Paper Trading Function (Buy/Sell)

### 🎯 Goal:
Develop a paper trading system to simulate buying and selling tokens without using real funds. This will allow testing and refining strategies in a risk-free environment.

### 🛠️ Tasks:
1. **Design the Paper Trading Module:**
   - Create a virtual wallet to track simulated balances.
   - Implement Buy/Sell functions that mimic real transactions.

2. **Integrate with Existing Modules:**
   - Connect the paper trading module to the transaction handler and strategy manager.
   - Ensure the filter and rug checker are applied to paper trades.

3. **Simulate Market Conditions:**
   - Use historical or real-time data to simulate price movements.
   - Include slippage and fees in the simulation for realism.

4. **Track Performance:**
   - Log all paper trades for analysis.
   - Calculate metrics like profit/loss, win rate, and drawdown.

5. **User Interface:**
   - Add commands to the Telegram bot for paper trading (e.g., `/paper_buy`, `/paper_sell`).
   - Display paper trading results in a clear format.

6. **Testing:**
   - Test the paper trading module with various scenarios.
   - Ensure it works seamlessly with the rest of the system.
